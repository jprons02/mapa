upload bug -
how to recreate:
    -select a file and do not click upload
    -go to select a file again, hit cancel
how i fixed it -
    -Error was within actions. I had to change the payload from payload: selectFile to the below:
    export const selectFile = (event) => dispatch => {
            const selectedFile = event.target.files[0];
            //payload is setup to work if user selects file then clicks cancel
            //event.target.files.length - if a file is selected it will be length of at least 1
            dispatch({type: SELECTED_FILE, payload: event.target.files.length > 0 ? selectedFile : null});
    }
